# Discord Bot Go

No-Hello-Bot is a Discord bot for Discord is an open-source bot that sends "no-hello" or gives you a prompt to give more context to your question!

This Discord bot is easy to set up and use. All you need to do is add it to your server and set up the words you'd like it to recognize. It will then let you know when it sees one of those words in chat and respond to it with a reply or a link to the no-hello site. 

## Getting Started

To get started with No-Hello-Bot, you'll need to add it to your Discord server.

1. Go to [this page](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=717596406498967564&permissions=8&scope=bot) and click "Add to Server".

2. Select the server you'd like to add the bot to and click "Authorize".

3. Once the bot has been added to your server, you can set up the words you'd like it to recognize. To do this, type `!hello-set <word>` in chat, where `<word>` is the word you'd like the bot to recognize. You can also type `!hello-set all` to have the bot respond to any word it sees.

Once you've set up the words you'd like the bot to recognize, it will start responding to them with fun gifs. Enjoy!
